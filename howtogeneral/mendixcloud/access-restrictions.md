## 1 Restricting access for incoming requests to your Application

By configuring Access Restrictions, you have fine grained control over external access to your application.

Restrictions can be applied to the top level of the application URL, '/', but also to more specific paths, like e.g. '/ws/', or '/odata/'. 
Presets are available to simply allow or deny all access. 
Additionaly, custom profiles can be assembled using IP range filters and a Client Certificate Authority.

Note:

* This feature is available from INSERT DATE for **Mendix Cloud v4** environments
* **Mendix Cloud v3** environments will be converted from the current "Request Handlers" based configuration on INSERT DATE. Please see the WHATS NEW PAGE about this conversion.

## 2 Configuring an Access Restriction Profile

The most important things you should know about configuring an Access Restriction Profile:

* Access Restriction Profiles are configured on application level. They can be reused in all environments (Test, Acceptance, Production) of the application
* Access Restriction Profiles can contain any number of IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges, or a Client Certificate Authority, or both
* If an Access Restriction Profiles contains both IP address ranges and a Client Certificate Authority, then any match on either IP range or Client Certificate will grant access

### 2.1 Known limitations

* The Client Certificate option is not yet available for Mendix Cloud v4 environments
* The IP Range filter option is not available in Mendix Cloud v3 environments hosted outside of the Netherlands
* When using Client Certificate restrictions, the client certifcate CA in all active profiles must be identical. In other words, it's only possible to use a single CA for the entire application environment

## 3 Applying a restriction to an application environment

To apply a restriction to a specific application environment:

1. Go to the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com) and select your App.
2. Click **Environment** under the **Deploy** category.
3. Click **Details** of the desired environment.
4. Go to the **Network** tab. 
5. The section **Path Based Access Restrictions** allows applying access restrictions for a single environment.

Note: 

* The top level path '/' restricts access to the entire application
* Settings for specific paths override the implicitely inherited profile for the top level
* Besides being able to apply a custom created Access Restriction Profile, there are also presets available for simply allowing or denying all access

### 3.1 Default settings

* When deploying a deployment packagee to an environment, using the **Deploy** or **Transport** functionality, paths representing known functionality in the Mendix version that is used will automatically be added to the list of paths
* All paths ending in '-doc' will have a preset **Deny all access** profile set by default
* All remaining paths will have no restriction applied by default

## 4 Use cases for Access Restrictions

There are two scenario's where you can use access restrictions described below:

### 4.1 Example Scenario 1 - Restricting access based on an IP Range

An example scenario in which a basic IP Range restriction could be used is when an application running in the Mendix Cloud is only to be accessed from a single office. The interactive web browser interface of the application should only be accessible to employees in the office of the company running the application, and from the rest of the internet, the login screen of the application should not even be visible.

The following steps will simply restrict access to the whole application to an IP Range:

1. Go to the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com) and select your App.
2. Click **Environment** under the **Deploy** category.
3. Go to the **Access Restriction Profiles** tab of the application.

4. Create a restriction profile.
5. Add one or more IP Ranges to the restriction profile.

6. Go to the **Deploy** tab and click **Details** of the desired environment.
7. Select the **Network** tab of an application environment.

8. Apply the profile to the top level path '/'. All other more specific paths will inherit this profile if they do not have a setting of their own.

### 4.2 Example Scenario 2 - A backend administration with third party web service integrations.

The second example scenario is an extended version of the first scenario above. The application which was protected with the IP Range restriction now starts to provide web service integrations that will be called by third parties. Since the IP Range restriction is in place already, the web service endpoints are not reachable for the external parties.

By adding an additional Access Restriction Profile and applying it on the path '/ws/' only, we can however specifically grant access to the webservice endpoints. Moreover, the example company decides to standardize on the usage of TLS Client Certificates, so they do not have to manage lists of IP ranges for each external third party.

1. Go to the [Developer Portal](http://home.mendix.com) and select your App.
2. Click **Environment** under the **Deploy** category.
3. Go to the **Access Restriction Profiles** tab of the application.

4. Create a restriction profile.
5. Add the certificate of the internal Certificate Authority that is used to sign the client certificates to the restriction profile.

6. Go to the **Deploy** tab and click **Details** of the desired environment.
7. Select the **Network** tab of an application environment.

8. Apply the restriction profile to '/ws/' path of the environment. For this specific path, the profile that was chosen for the top level '/' will now be overridden.

Note: If it's desired that the '/ws/' path can still be reached from the office location without using a client certificate, then also add the IP Ranges of the office location again to the profile that is used on '/ws/'.
